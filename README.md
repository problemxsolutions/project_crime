# project_crime
Project focused on the workflow to analyze criminal activity data.

For the associated posts providing context and details for the scripts in this project, please refer to these:

## Project Planning
This post describes the project and lays out an initial project plan to help structure my tasks, ideas and references.  This post also leads into collecting the  primary crime data used for the entire project.

## Data Search
The next posts detailing "Data Search" describe each of the parts of the project that I would like to gather supplemental data to mix in and analyze with my primary source of criminal activity data.  

### Part 1 
Focuses on Map Data.  This provides spatial polygons to structure the analysis and provide visual context.  The spatial regions referenced in the criminal activity data as well so matching up the data sources should not require much transformation.

### Part 2
Focuses on weather and solar/lunar activity.
* https://problemxsolutions.com/project/crime/criminal-analysis-data-search-part-2/

### Part 3
Focuses on employment/unemployment data and labor statistics.  There is also a blurb on real estate data and additional map data.

### Part 4
Focuses on real estate, permit (building and construction) and economic data.

## Data Storage
These two post describe creating a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database to store all the data for this project.

### PostgreSQL 
* https://problemxsolutions.com/project/crime/criminal-analysis-data-storage/

### PostGIS
* https://problemxsolutions.com/project/crime/criminal-analysis-data-storage-part-2/

### Elastic Stack
* coming soon "Data Storage (part 3)"

## Data Exploration
This portion of the project will look at each dataset loaded into the database and explore what is provided and identify any transformations.
